                    <h1><u>Class of 2020</u></h1>
                    <time datetime = "05-19-2020">May 19, 2020</time>
                    <p>2011, I remember going to my sister's high school graduation and thinking that I too would one day be walking across a stage in my cap and gown receiving my diploma. I never would have thought my senior year would be unlike any other, and that I would never be able to experience what it would be like to walk the stage or sit among the tightly packed rows with my peers to be recognized for our achievements. The past 6 years were a blur, but I decided that it would be meaningful to reflect upon my time at I.S. and to pay tribute to the memories I’ve made.</p>
                    <p> My journey at I.S. started unconventionally. I started my first day of 7th grade at Tyee MS, I remember coming home with a folder full of syllabuses from my new teachers that I would never meet again. My second day started subsequently at I.S. where I was surrounded by new peers and new teachers. Despite being the new kid, I quickly found a group of good friends from elementary school and quickly found my place within the I.S. community. Middle school was an emotional rollercoaster, but I was also grateful to have a good group of friends to support me along the way. I always looked forward to lunchtime, where we would play card games, and do stupid things. </p>
                    <p>High School was a drastic transition from Middle School. The realization that my grades mattered changed my work ethic and attitude towards my academics. Freshman year was a blast and the first year I had participated in the FIRST Robotics Competition. That year we went to the world championships in Houston, Texas, a moment in my life I’ll never forget. Sophomore year I was challenged when I took my first science AP class– AP CHEM. I failed a test for the first time ever and felt hopeless. Luckily, I pulled through with the support of my family and friends. Not before long it was Junior year. I worked the hardest that year and it paid off in terms of my academic performance. </p>
                    <p>Reflecting on my time at I.S. these moments shaped me as the person I am today. Despite not being able to celebrate these moments, I am proud to see what I’ve achieved and am thankful for those around me who have helped me along the way. And to the class of 2020 we’re making it through a major historical event, what else can’t we do?</p>
